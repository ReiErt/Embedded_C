Readme for basic_timer_example:

TIMER: TASK 1:
Using UART.h, write a user-friendly menu (a terminal program) that allows you to manager a timer.
To control the timer, the menu should offer the following parameters:

1. Start timer
2. Stop timer (the terminal should display the remaining time)
3. Input timer duration
4. Print timer duration.

The character strings that you need to output for the menu via serial interfance should be stored as constants in EEPROM.

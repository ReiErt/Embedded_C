Task: ADC

1. Initialise the Atmega328p's native ADC. Use the controller's voltage as the reference voltage.
2. Connecting a potentiometer to 5V, measure the analogue voltage with a frequency rate of 125KHz.
3. Convert the acquired digital voltage value to millivolt and use UART to print this to terminal.
4. Simultaneously measure the room temperature with ATMega's native thermometer in celcius.
